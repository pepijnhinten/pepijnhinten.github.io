Welcome to my blog — posts are just simple Markdown files.  
Updating is as easy as writing text and dropping pictures in the repo.

## A picture

Here is the image embedded via **Markdown** (this is the correct syntax):

![Mipham](/assets/img/Mipham.jpg)

You can also include **alt text** (recommended for accessibility):

![Mipham, portrait](/assets/img/Mipham.jpg)

And here’s the **HTML** version if you want control over width and caption:

<figure style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/img/Mipham.jpg" alt="Mipham" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:8px;">
  <figcaption style="color:#b8b8c2; font-size:.95rem; margin-top:6px;">
    Figure 1. A short caption describing the image.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
