Welcome to my blog — posts are just simple Markdown files.  
Updating is as easy as writing text and dropping pictures in the repo.

## A picture

Here is the image embedded via Markdown:

/assets/img/Mipham.jpg

*Alt text example (recommended for accessibility):*

/assets/img/Mipham.jpg

You can also use HTML if you want to control width or add a caption:

/assets/img/Mipham.jpg

*Figure 1. A short caption describing the image.*
