Welcome to my blog — posts are simple Markdown files.  
Updating is as easy as writing text and dropping pictures in the repo.

## A picture

Upload your image to `assets/img/` and reference it like this:

![Sunrise in Deventer](assets/img/Mipham.jpg)

You can also control size with HTML if you prefer:

<img src="assets/img/Mipham.jpg" alt="Mipham Rinpoche" width="640" />
